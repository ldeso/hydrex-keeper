# hydrex-keeper

A Cloud Run job that casts the weekly Hydrex vote of the Klima "Carbon Impact" conduit on Base. It signs with the Cloud
KMS key of [hydrex-keeper-key](https://github.com/ldeso/hydrex-keeper-key) and calls `vote` on the Safe module of
[hydrex-conduit-executor](https://github.com/ldeso/hydrex-conduit-executor), which forwards it to Hydrex's Voter.

- `src/`: the job, with `viem` as its only dependency. `select.ts` is the strategy, `kms.ts` signs, and `vote.ts` is the
  only place a transaction is built and sent.
- `tokens.json`: the tokens whose rewards count, by address: WETH, cbBTC, SOL, USDC, USDT, USD₮0, EURC, BNKR, VVV, HYDX,
  kVCM and the ST0x tokenized stocks and ETFs (`wt…`). Rewards in other tokens count as zero.
- `sh/` and `policy/`: the scripts that create the Google Cloud resources and check them for drift, and the IAM policies
  they write in full.

## How it votes

Cloud Scheduler starts the job at 23:50 UTC on Tuesday and Wednesday. The first execution votes a day before the
Thursday 00:00 UTC epoch flip, as a fallback. The second votes again in the last two blocks before the flip.

Both read this epoch's bribes and fees in every pool of Hydrex's Voter with a live gauge, keep those paid in the tokens
of `tokens.json`, and price them in USD. The vote a day before the flip splits the conduit's votes in proportion to the
pools' rewards. The last pass splits them to maximise the expected reward: `x` votes on a pool with `V` votes from
others and `usd` of rewards should earn `usd × x / (V + x)`. Either way, pools that would get less than 0.1% of the
votes are left out, and so are all but the 40 with the largest shares: each pool voted for adds two bribe deposits to
the transaction, a share that small earns almost nothing, and more pools could take a vote past the 16.8M gas a Base
transaction may use. Votes do not carry over from one epoch to the next, so the vote a day before the flip is always
cast; the last pass votes again only if that pays at least 1% more. A vote's max fee is twice the base fee plus the tip;
if either of the last two blocks was at least 90% full, the tip rises to the 99th percentile of their tips, up to 0.1
gwei.

The last pass votes as late as possible, to see as many of the other votes as it can. It starts a minute before the
flip: it reads and prices the rewards, then polls the block being built, which Base builds in sub-blocks about every 200
ms. The polls tell it when blocks are sealed and when their last sub-block starts, wherever that falls within the second
and however far apart blocks are. Two blocks before its first vote, it starts reading the block being built every 100
ms, with the votes others sent so far, and keeps a vote signed for the latest read. It sends that vote in each of the
last two blocks before the flip, 200 ms before the block's last sub-block starts: about 0.8 s before the block's
timestamp. The deadlines come from the block timing alone: if reads or polls hang or fail, the vote sent is the latest
that was ready, from an earlier read or from the minute before.

A failing vote a day before the flip is tried up to three times. If it still fails, the execution exits non-zero, an
email alert fires, and Cloud Run restarts it up to three times. A restart runs that vote if it fell due within the past
hour, and does nothing within the hour after the flip. Nothing is sent after the flip; voting then reverts anyway. After
the flip, the last pass reads where its votes landed, and fails if one reverted before the flip, if it had nothing to
send, or if the Voter shows no vote of the conduit this epoch.

Every log line is JSON: each pass logs each pool's rewards, the vote it prepares, and the recorded vote. The last pass
also logs the votes on each pool, the block timing it learned and what it sends in each block.

## Trust

- The job only calls `vote`, for pools with a live gauge that pay rewards in the tokens of `tokens.json`. KMS signs; the
  key never leaves the HSM. The job's service account has no role in its own project beyond reading its secrets.
- The key can do more than the job does: as the module's `KEEPER`, it can vote for any pool and call
  `claimSwapAndDistribute` with any swap calldata for the conduit's approved routers. Anyone who can run code as the
  job's service account, such as an owner of the keeper project, has that power.
- The module, the conduit and the Voter check the rest: the caller, gauge liveness, voting power, epoch timing.

## Setup

Needs `gcloud`, `jq` and `curl`, and Node 26 for development. `sh/setup.sh` and `sh/deploy.sh` need `roles/owner` on the
keeper project; `sh/check.sh` needs `roles/viewer`, `roles/iam.securityReviewer` and `roles/secretmanager.viewer`. Every
script is safe to re-run.

1. **Configure.** Run `cp config.env.example config.env`, then fill in `KEEPER_PROJECT` (a project for this job only),
   `KMS_KEY_VERSION` (`version` in the key repo's `record/keeper.json`) and `ALERT_EMAIL`. The defaults match the
   deployed module and the sibling repos.
2. **Create the resources.** `sh/setup.sh` enables the APIs, and creates the job's service account (the only one allowed
   to sign), the scheduler's (which may only start the job), the secrets, and email alerts on a failed execution and on
   a failed start. It prints the job's service account.
3. **Grant the key.** In hydrex-keeper-key, set `KEEPER_SA` to that service account and run `sh/grant.sh`.
4. **Add the secrets.** Add the RPC URL with
   `printf '%s' 'https://…' | gcloud secrets versions add base-rpc-url --project=KEEPER_PROJECT --data-file=-`, then an
   Alchemy API key to `alchemy-api-key` the same way, and a CoinGecko Demo API key if `COINGECKO_SECRET` is set. Several
   RPC URLs can be given, separated by commas. Public nodes, which rate-limit, are tried after them.
5. **Fund the keeper.** Send ETH on Base to `KEEPER`, `0x625CF6663d9D090535FBd57680bFFE6fA0262434`. A vote costs about
   0.00005 ETH, so 0.005 ETH pays for about 100. The job refuses to vote with less than twice the cost of a vote.
6. **Deploy.** `sh/deploy.sh` builds the image with Cloud Build, deploys the job, lets only the scheduler's account
   start it, and creates its scheduler job, deleting stale ones. Re-run it after any change to `src/` or `tokens.json`.
7. **Try it.** `sh/run.sh --dry-run --now` runs the vote of a day before the flip at once and signs with KMS, but sends
   nothing. `sh/run.sh --now` votes. Read the logs in Cloud Run.
8. **Check for drift.** `sh/check.sh` compares the project with `config.env` and `policy/`, read-only: service accounts,
   keys, environment, secrets, IAM, schedules and alerts. It also fails if the keeper holds less than 0.001 ETH.

The `check` workflow runs `sh/check.sh` every Friday and on demand. It uses a read-only service account in the keeper
project, reached by Workload Identity Federation from this repository through the `WIF_PROVIDER` and
`CI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` repository variables, and builds `config.env` from the repository variables named in
`config.env.example`.

Outside the scripts:

- Enforce `iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` on the keeper project; `check.sh` only detects keys.
- Change `tokens.json` by pull request, then redeploy.

## Failure modes

- **Base RPC:** a call that fails, or gets no answer within 250 ms, also goes to the next URL, and the first answer
  wins. If all fail, the pass fails. The vote is sent to every URL. In the last pass, a poll that hangs is dropped after
  500 ms, and up to three reads run at once, so that one that hangs does not hold up the next.
- **Prices:** DefiLlama, Alchemy, and CoinGecko if set, three attempts each. A price is the median of three quotes, the
  lower of two, or the only one. If every source fails, the last prices are reused. The pass fails if there are none, or
  if no token has a price. Unpriced tokens count as zero.
- **Cloud KMS:** the pass fails. A signature that does not recover to `KEEPER` is never sent.
- **Cloud Scheduler:** a failed start is retried three times within five minutes, and emails an alert. A paused or
  deleted schedule does neither; `check.sh` reports it.
- **Hydrex's minter:** if the Voter's epoch lags the calendar, the job refuses to vote.

## Development

Run `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm test`, and `npm run format` before committing.
`MODULE=0x750973E0CB728C3112561Bc8E9b235afA9B17E81 BASE_RPC_URLS=… npm run dry-run` runs the vote of a day before the
flip against Base without KMS and sends nothing; `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` and `COINGECKO_API_KEY` add their price sources.
`test/sh/golden.sh` runs the scripts under `dash` (or `$TEST_SH`) against a fake `gcloud` and `curl`, and compares the
calls and output with `test/sh/golden/`; `--update` rewrites them.

CI runs these checks, Prettier, `shellcheck` and `reuse lint`, and builds the image on every push. Dependabot updates
the pinned Actions, npm packages and base images.

## Limitations

- The expected reward assumes the other voters stay put. The last pass sees the votes sent until about 2 s before the
  flip, but not those sent later. It reads the rewards a minute before the flip, and misses those paid later, which is
  rare: fees are paid every five minutes, and none came in the last minute of the epochs looked at.
- Claiming and swapping rewards are not implemented.
